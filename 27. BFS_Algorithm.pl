% Define a heuristic function (h/2) that estimates the cost from a state to the goal.
% Modify this function based on your problem's specific requirements.
% In this example, we use a simple heuristic that returns a fixed value of 1.
h(State, 1).

% Define a predicate to generate successor states based on your problem's transition rules.
% Modify this predicate based on your problem's specific requirements.
% In this example, we define a simple problem with three states: a, b, and c.
successor(a, [b, c]).
successor(b, [c]).

% Define the BFS algorithm.
% The main BFS predicate takes the current state and the list of open states.
% It returns the solution path as a list.
bfs(State, SolutionPath) :-
    bfs([(State, [])], [], SolutionPath).

% Base case: If the open list is empty, there's no solution.
bfs([], _, _) :-
    write('No solution found.'), nl,
    fail.

% Recursive case: Expand the first state in the open list.
% If the goal state is reached, return the path.
bfs([(State, Path)|_], _, Path) :-
    goal(State).

% Recursive case: Expand the first state in the open list.
% Add its successors to the open list while maintaining their paths.
% Sort the open list based on the heuristic function.

             not(member(NextState, Closed))),
            NewStates),
    append(RestOpen, NewStates, UpdatedOpen),
    predsort(compare_heuristic, UpdatedOpen, SortedOpen),
    bfs(SortedOpen, [State|Closed], SolutionPath).

% Define a goal state. Modify this predicate based on your problem's specific requirements.
goal(c).

% Define a comparison predicate to sort states in the open list based on their heuristic values.
compare_heuristic(<, (State1, _), (State2, _)) :-
    h(State1, H1),
    h(State2, H2),
    H1 < H2.

% Example query:
% Find a solution path from state a to the goal state c.
